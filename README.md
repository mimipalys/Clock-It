# Clock-It
The purpose of this undergraduate thesis work is to turn the traditional way of attendance taking into a digital form of attendance taking. It provides a more accessible, safer, enjoyable, and hassle-free way of taking attendance for both the professor and the student. Clock-It is a digital attendance application developed on XCode using the Swift programming language, which will use NFC readers to take attendance. The app will work by the principle of the student having a digital card on their phone and using it to take their attendance. By developing an app that can export to a native wallet app provided by the operating system (OS) of the phone, such as Apple Wallet on iOS, and an NFC reader, which would be attached to every room that lectures and labs would be held in. The app is meant to help the professors by taking off the responsibility of taking attendance. The app would work by the student having the app installed on their phone and opening their digital card (whether on the app itself or enabled on a native wallet app provided by an OS), and taping their phone on the NFC reader.
